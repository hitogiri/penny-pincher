# Penny Pincher

A highly intuitive daily expense tracker to facilitate monetary management.

#### Full Website: https://penny-pincher-cjv6.onrender.com/


## How It's Made

#### Tech used : MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, EJS, Node, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Tailwind

This full-stack web application was created using the EJS templating language for the frontend and MongoDB as the backend database, leveraging Node.js and Express for server-side operations. Utilizing the MEEN stack allowed for quick development and seamless integration of requisite middlewares. It follows the MVC design pattern, allowing for maintainability as well as scalability. Styled with Tailwind, this app also offers a dark mode that can be toggled manually.

### Packages/Dependencies:
* [passport](https://github.com/alec-chernicki/palettable)
* [passport-google-oauth20](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-google-oauth2)
* [bcrypt](https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js#readme)
* [express-recaptcha](https://github.com/fereidani/recaptcha2)
* [express-session](https://github.com/expressjs/session)
* [express-validator](https://github.com/express-validator/express-validator)
* [express-flash](https://github.com/RGBboy/express-flash)
* [method-override](https://github.com/expressjs/method-override)
* [morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan)

## Optimizations

#### Here's a few features that I'm looking forward to including or improving:

* Users can review expenditures by weekday.
* Weekly spending summary.
* "Budget" feature.
* More consistent dark mode behavior with Firexox





## Lessons Learned

This was the first time I implemented a dark mode feature that affects multiple pages. The inclusion of a dark mode switch for single page applications is rather straightforward, but doing so for a full-stack application with multiple pages was quite a fun challenge.
